Assignment: Implement the most efficient algorithm to solve the given problem.

Problem Statement:
You are given a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with `n` nodes, numbered from `0` to `n-1`.
The graph is represented as an adjacency list where `graph[i]` is a list of tuples `(j, w)`,
representing an edge from node `i` to node `j` with weight `w`. Your task is to find the longest
path in the graph starting from any node.

Function Signature:
def longest_path(graph: list) -> int:

Parameters:
- graph (list): A list of lists, where `graph[i]` contains tuples `(j, w)` representing an edge
  from node `i` to node `j` with weight `w`.

Returns:
- int: The length of the longest path in the graph.

Example:
>>> graph = [
...     [(1, 3), (2, 2)],
...     [(3, 4)],
...     [(3, 1)],
...     []
... ]
>>> longest_path(graph)
